# MVVM with Protocols and Delegate Patterns in Swift

This repository showcases how to implement MVVM architecture using Protocol-Oriented Programming and Delegate Patterns in Swift. The project demonstrates how to establish seamless communication between the View and ViewModel without relying on Reactive Programming frameworks like Combine or RxSwift.

## Features
- Protocol-based communication to define contracts between layers.
- Delegate Pattern implementation for handling events and updates.
- Integration with Firestore for fetching user data.
- Testable and lightweight architecture design.
